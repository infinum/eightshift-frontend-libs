# Group Block

Block used to provide group functionality to your project. This block is an inner block (repeater) block that expects children blocks to be present. It is designed to group multiple children blocks into one block for simpler configuration and handling.

## Implementation

Open a terminal and type in this command inside your projects root:

```shell
wp boilerplate use_block --name=group
```

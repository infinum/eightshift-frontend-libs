# Carousel Block

Block used to provide carousel functionality to your project. This block is an inner block (repeater) block that expects children blocks to be present.

## Implementation

Open a terminal and type in this command inside your projects root:

```shell
wp boilerplate use_block --name=carousel
```

## Note

We used image block as a inner child but you can use anything you like. If you want to also add image block please check the image block readme.

## Important

We don't provide the library used for carousel block it is up to you to implement any library you want to use in your project.
However, we prefer to use Swiper as our carousel of choice.

To install swiper run this command in your project:
```shell
npm install swiper
```

# Map Block

Block that displays a map with various configurable layers. [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is used as the base for the map.

Various map layers are supported:
- OpenStreetMap raster (free)
- Mapbox vector maps (paid)
- Mapbox raster maps (paid)
- Vector maps (based on OpenStreetMap) with Mapbox-compatible styles (e.g. from MapTiler or Mapbox, paid)
- MapTiler raster maps (XYZ or JSON format, paid)
- MapTiler raster tiles (XYZ or JSON format, paid)
- MapTiler vector maps (XYZ, .pbf format, paid)
- GeoJSON

## Implementation

Open a terminal and type in this command inside your projects root:

```shell
wp boilerplate use_block --name=map
```

## Note

When customizing the block, if you want the editor preview to reflect any new settings, make sure to include the changes in `map-components.js`.

## Important

Make sure to install OpenLayers and OpenLayers MapBox styles:
```shell
npm install ol
npm install ol-mapbox-style
```

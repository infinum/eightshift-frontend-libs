# Skip Link Component

Component used to provide skip functionality to your project.

## Implementation

Open a terminal and type in this command inside your projects root:

```shell
wp boilerplate blocks use-component --name=skip-link
```

## Usage considerations

If you're using skip links to improve accessibility on your website
(e. g., to conform to WCAG SC 2.4.1.), skip links should be the
first focusable elements on your website or the applicable content block.

This component doesn't modify the tabindex, so browsers automatically
calculate its inherent tab order based on the position in the DOM.
This is to support WCAG Techniques G1, G123 and G124 with the same component.

Depending on which technique you use, you'll probably need to do one of the following:
  * ensure the component is positioned in the DOM so that it's the first focusable element, and there are no elements with a tabindex that prevents that
  * add a tabindex to the component

For more information on using skip links to improve accessibility, please see [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html).

To set the skip link target, set the `skipLinkTarget` attribute.

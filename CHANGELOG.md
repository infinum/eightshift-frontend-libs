### Added
* Missing registerBlocks import.
* Scroll-to-target component that has two options: target element to scroll to and text of the scroll-to link.

* Added support for `behind` and `top` drawers / mobile menus (slide from top or fade in).

* Removed some `height: 100%` which made styling links difficult and coupled to header / footer height.
* `page-overlay` added to script init project.
* `editor-color-palette` - Modified the `ColorPaletteCustom` component to get colors by default from WordPress's global store.
* `editor-color-palette` - Modified all uses of `ColorPaletteCustom` component to not override default colors (except for wrapper).
* `editor-color-palette` - Added a helper (using React hooks) for reading colors from WordPress's global store.
* Added docs for `editor-color-palette`.

# ServerSideRender
*Originally created by [David Gwyer](https://github.com/dgwyer/server-side-render-x)*

This is an improved version of the built-in `ServerSideRender` component.

The main difference is that instead of showing a full-size placeholder instead of the content
while the new content is being fetched, it keeps the snapshot of the current content and adds
a little spinner in the top-right corner (configurable), so the editing UX is better.

It is used in the same way as the default `ServerSideRender` component:

```jsx
<ServerSideRender
	block="eightshift-boilerplate/paragraph"
	attributes={{ ...attributes, wrapperUse: false }}
/>
```
